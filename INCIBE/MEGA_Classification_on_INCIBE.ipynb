              "{'DESCRIPTION': \" The White House says the program is part of a broader cybersecurity plan designed to address issues across the nation's critical infrastructure.. The 100-day initiative will involve government agencies that are responsible for the security of critical infrastructure as well as businesses and private utilities that oversee or own infrastructure, such as electrical distribution systems that deliver power to homes.. Public-private partnership is paramount to the administration's efforts because protecting our nation's critical infrastructure is a shared responsibility of government and the owners and operators of that infrastructure, says Emily Horne, a spokesperson for the National Security Council.. Some lawmakers and a government watchdog agency have recently criticized the Department of Energy for its cybersecurity practices, especially in the wake of the SolarWinds supply chain attack, which led to follow-on attacks on the DOE and eight other federal agencies, plus 100 companies.. In March, the Government Accountability Office released a report that found the U.S. electrical grid's distribution systems, which deliver electricity directly to customers, are increasingly vulnerable to cyberthreats and urged the Energy Department to incorporate these systems into its cybersecurity plans (see: GAO: Electrical Grid's Distribution Systems More Vulnerable).. Some security experts have criticized President Joe Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure spending proposal for lacking cybersecurity specifics, including security enhancements for the nation's electrical grid. Others analysts, however, noted that any improvements in infrastructure would likely strengthen security by updating and replacing older equipment (see: Biden's Infrastructure Plan: 3 Cybersecurity Provisions).. Security Improvements. As part of the 100-day plan for the nation's electrical grid, the Energy Department's Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, or CESER, will work with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and private utilities to make a series of cybersecurity improvements.. The goals of the project include:. Encouraging owners and operators of power plants and facilities to enhance security incident detection, mitigation, response and forensic capabilities;. Deploying technologies to allow for real-time situational awareness within industrial control systems and operational technology networks;. Reinforcing the IT networks and infrastructure used within facilities;. Deploying technologies to increase the visibility of threats within ICS and OT systems.. The Energy Department also is seeking suggestions from electric utilities, energy companies, academia, research laboratories, government agencies and others for improving supply chain security within U.S. energy systems.. Modernization. While the emphasis on protecting and shoring up cybersecurity around the nation's electrical grid is long overdue, updating and improving complex OT and ICS systems will be a time-consuming process, says Austin Berglas, who formerly was an assistant special agent in charge of cyber investigations at the FBI's New York office.. Operational technology - or computing systems used to manage industrial operations opposed to administrative actions - often rely on outdated, unprotected systems that were not manufactured with security in mind, says Berglas, who is now global head of professional services at cybersecurity firm BlueVoyant. In many instances, this will require a complete transformation of process and technology. There will need to be a significant investment in resources, both human and capital, to bring many energy companies up to a higher standard of cybersecurity.. Padraic O'Reilly, co-founder and chief product officer of CyberSaint Security, also notes that when making changes and updates to ICS and OT systems, the federal government is in a unique position to help private organizations focus on what needs to be modernized.. With so much of the infrastructure privatized and in need of modernization, it can be difficult to get everyone pulling in the same direction, and the Department of Energy and CISA can really help with this, O'Reilly says.. Growing Concerns. Lawmakers are growing more concerned about cyberthreats facing the nation's electrical grid, including from nation-state attackers and others.. In March, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators sent a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm demanding that the DOE place a greater emphasis on cybersecurity as part of strategic planning and that the new administration keep the leadership of CESER in place to better respond to threats (see: Senators Raise Concerns About Energy Dept. Cybersecurity).. At a recent U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, about China's ability to use cyber tools to disrupt natural gas pipelines and Russia's ability to interfere with the U.S. electrical grid (see: Senators Push for Changes in Wake of SolarWinds Attack).. Nakasone acknowledged that China and Russia have continued to improve their cyber capabilities and noted that the U.S. government is looking to strengthen its defenses for critical infrastructure.\",\n",

The investigation is ongoing.. To date, Visa, MasterCard and Discover have notified us that approximately 2,400 unique customer payment cards used at Neiman Marcus and Last Call stores were subsequently used fraudulently, Katz says in the company's statement. Last Call is a retail clearance center with 28 locations owned by Neiman Marcus.. No fraudulent activity has yet been linked to Neiman Marcus or Bergdorf Goodman payment cards, the statement notes. Bergdorf Goodman is a subsidiary of Neiman Marcus.. So far, the retailer says its investigation has revealed that personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers and dates of birth, was not compromised. The retailer also notes that online purchases and PINs were not adversely affected by the breach. We do not use PIN pads in our stores, Katz states in the Jan. 22 statement.. Like Target Corp., which announced its network breach Dec. 19, Neiman Marcus is stressing its zero liability for consumers adversely affected by fraudulent charges.. The policies of the payment brands such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and the Neiman Marcus card provide that you have zero liability for any unauthorized charges if you report them in a timely manner, the company says. Please contact your card brand or issuing bank for more information about the policy that applies to you.. Neiman Marcus also is offering free credit monitoring to all customers who conducted transactions at Neiman Marcus or Last Call from January 2013 to January 2014. We are notifying all customers for whom we have addresses or e-mail, the company says..

Here's what happened at Facebook, according to its blog:. Several Facebook employees visited a mobile developer website that was compromised. The compromised website hosted an exploit that then allowed malware to be installed on these employees' laptops.. The laptops were fully-patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software, the blog says. As soon as we discovered the presence of the malware, we remediated all infected machines, informed law enforcement and began a significant investigation that continues to this day.. Facebook Security flagged a suspicious domain in its corporate DNS (Domain Name Servers) logs and tracked it back to an employee laptop. The security team conducted a forensic examination of that laptop and identified a malicious file, and then searched company-wide and flagged several other compromised employee laptops.. After analyzing the compromised website where the attack originated, Facebook found the site was using a previously unseen, zero-day exploit to bypass the Java sandbox (built-in protections) to install the malware. Facebook immediately reported the exploit to Oracle, and Oracle confirmed Facebook's findings and provided a patch on Feb. 1 that addressed the vulnerability.. Facebook says it wasn't the only victim of this exploit. It is clear that others were attacked and infiltrated recently as well, the blog says. As one of the first companies to discover this malware, we immediately took steps to start sharing details about the infiltration with the other companies and entities that were affected. We plan to continue collaborating on this incident through an informal working group and other means.. The social-media company says it is working with law enforcement and the other organizations affected by this attack. It is in everyone's interests for our industry to work together to prevent attacks such as these in the future, Facebook says.. Sharing threat information has received much attention in Washington this past week. President Obama, in his State of the Union address on Feb. 12, announced an executive order that calls on the government to share cyberthreat information with critical infrastructure owners and called for legislation to allow businesses to share threat information with the government and with each other [see Obama Issues Cybersecurity Executive Order]. The following day, the heads of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence introduced a bill to do just that [see Is Compromise in Offing for CISPA?]. Facebook is the latest high-profiled media company to reveal it's been victimized by intruders. The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Twitter and Washington Post have reported their websites being attacked [see N.Y. Times' Transparent Hack Response and Twitter, Washington Post Report Cyberattacks].. The Facebook attack is reminiscent of the 2011 breach at security provider RSA, when a well-crafted e-mail tricked an RSA employee to retrieve from a junk-mail folder and open a message containing a virus that led to a sophisticated attack on the company's information systems [see 'Tricked' RSA Worker Opened Backdoor to APT Attack].</td>\n",

(ISC)² collected survey data from over 4,500 cybersecurity professionals. Only 4 percent of respondents reported working in healthcare, which validates previous findings of inadequate IT staffing within the sector.. LASTING CONSEQUENCES OF A CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE SHORTAGE. The cybersecurity workforce gap, which (ISC)² defines as the number of additional professionals that organizations need to adequately defend their critical assets, decreased from 2.12 million last year to 2.72 million this year. The study also revealed that in 2021, over three-quarters of respondents reported being satisfied or extremely satisfied with their jobs.. While this improvement in numbers and job satisfaction shows promise, increasing the workforce by 65 percent is not an easy task. As current cybersecurity professionals continue to work in the middle of the workforce shortage, negative consequences may emerge.. A workforce shortage can result in employee burnout, as exhibited by the current nationwide clinician shortage. For IT teams, the shortage could mean that employees are stretched too thin and may miss key vulnerabilities and suspicious network activity as a result.. READ MORE: Security Automation, Collaboration Prove Critical For Healthcare. Cyberattacks on the healthcare sectors are ramping up, which naturally requires a more robust IT security team. A report conducted by CyberMDX and Philips found that hospitals in particular are struggling with a cybersecurity talent shortage. Respondents reported struggling to fill jobs within 100 days of posting new roles.. Without proper staffing to account for common vulnerabilities, healthcare organizations may face risks to patient safety and costly recovery costs in the event of a cyberattack.. (ISC)² survey respondents reported misconfigured systems, not enough time to focus on risk management and assessment, slower patching of critical systems, and oversights in processes and procedures as a consequence of being short-staffed. Respondents also reported high rates of rushed deployments and the inability to remain aware of all active threats.. LACK OF DIVERSITY IN THE CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE LIMITS POTENTIAL. The report indicated that the global cybersecurity community is well-educated, technically grounded, and strongly compensated.. However, the field is about three-quarters male and Caucasian, which reveals significant missed opportunities for bright minds to join the field and contribute diverse perspectives.. READ MORE: Recent Health Data Breaches Cause EHR Downtime, Deploy Malware. A few government agencies and private sector organizations are actively trying to combat the lack of diversity in the cybersecurity workforce.. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently awarded $2 million to two organizations to develop cyber workforce training programs in underserved communities in rural and urban areas.. The three-year pilot program, led by NPower and CyberWarrior, will focus on developing a comprehensive retention strategy and delivering accessible entry-level cybersecurity training while providing opportunities to underserved communities.. President Biden, along with a coalition of private companies, recently announced numerous national cybersecurity initiatives aimed at increasing the availability of cybersecurity training and education.. IBM pledged to train 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over the next three years and partner with more than 20 Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities to establish Cybersecurity Leadership Centers. Girls Who Code announced that it will establish a micro-credentialing program for historically excluded groups in technology. In addition, Code.org said it will teach cybersecurity concepts to three million students over the next three years.. READ MORE: Growing Number of States Enact New Genetic Data Privacy Laws. It is crucial that organizations acknowledge the lack of diversity in the cybersecurity workforce and work to improve it.. HOW ORGANIZATIONS CAN NARROW THE GAP. The study suggested that organizations begin by embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).. “DEI is a catalyst for positive change,” the study asserted.. “Organizations that take a hard look at their own skills gap, reconsider the qualities that make a successful cybersecurity professional, focus on their people before technology and remove geographical barriers through remote work will tap into a broader pool of talent that opens up new possibilities. Cybersecurity professionals are not only aware of how DEI can contribute to solving the skills gap, but they expect their employers to act.”. Organizations should also consider prioritizing investments in existing staff before investing in technology to improve their security posture. By focusing on recruitment, development, and retention, organizations can build a cohesive team of competent cybersecurity professionals.. Survey respondents reported investing in training, providing more flexible working conditions, investing in DEI programs, and addressing pay gaps in order to address the workforce gap.. Organizations may also consider investing in automation technologies, cloud service providers, and involving cybersecurity staff earlier in product design and development to alleviate the challenges of the ongoing workforce shortage..

              "      <td>The botnet, which was uncovered in October by Juniper researchers, originally targeted vulnerable Linux applications as well as IoT devices, according to the report. The operators behind Gitpaste-12 were also using legitimate services, such as GitHub and Pastebin, to help hide the malware's infrastructure (see: Botnet Operators Abusing Legit GitHub, Pastebin Resources).. The initial wave of Gitpaste-12 attacks started in July but was not uncovered until October, when the GitHub repository that was hosting the bulk of the worm's payloads was removed. On Nov. 10, the Juniper researchers discovered a second round of attacks had started, according to the report.. The Juniper analysis notes that seven of the vulnerability exploits found in the latest version were ported over from the previous Gitpaste-12 sample. The worm also attempts to compromise open Android Debug Bridge connections and existing malware backdoors.. The [latest] wave of attacks used payloads from yet another GitHub repository, which contained a Linux cryptominer ('ls'), a list of passwords for brute-force attempts ('pass') and a statically linked Python 3.9 interpreter of unknown provenance, the researchers note in the report.. The Juniper analysis also notes the latest version contains a cryptomining tool that mines for monero virtual currency, as was the case in the earlier version.. GitHub has taken down a section of its platform used to host the malicious worm, which slowed its spread, the researcher say.. Initial Attack. The Juniper researchers who examined the second wave of attacks also found a repository of new attacks vectors in one of the malware's variants that they examined.. That variant, which the researchers call 10-inix, is a UPX-packed binary written in the Go programming language and compiled for x86_64 Linux systems. The repository contained the 31 vulnerabilities that the worm would look for, according to the report.. Many of the vulnerabilities exploited are new, with public disclosures and proof-of-concept exploits dated as recently as September, the researchers say.. Although the X10-unix attacks vary depending on the operating systems and architectures targeted, each of these attacks tries to install the monero cryptomining malware, install the appropriate version of the X10-unix worm and open a backdoor that listens for instructions on ports 30004 and 30006, the report notes.. X10-unix also attempts to connect to Android Debug Bridge connections on port 5555, according to the report.. While it's difficult to ascertain the breadth or effectiveness of this malware campaign, in part because monero - unlike bitcoin - does not have publicly traceable transactions, [Juniper Threat Labs] can confirm over a hundred distinct hosts have been observed propagating the infection, the researchers note.. Other Botnet Activity. Other researchers have also noted several new botnets that target vulnerable Linux-based devices as well as IoT devices.. In May, for example, researchers uncovered a botnet dubbed Kaiji that uses brute-force methods targeting the SSH protocol to infect endpoints, which also allows it to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks (see: Kaiji Botnet Targets Linux Servers, IoT Devices).. In October, researchers at security firm Avira Protection Lab identified a new strain of the Mirai botnet targeting vulnerable IoT devices (see: Even in Test Mode, New Mirai Variant Infecting IoT Devices).</td>\n",

              "      <td>Organizations can use a cloud-native app protection platform, or CNAPP, to bolster their security processes.. It is not uncommon for organizations to bite off more than they can chew by procuring various point-solutions to beef up their cloud security. However, these tools (which may come from different vendors) often target specific security issues in their respective silos. These silos block information exchange, making it much more difficult to identify threats and prevent attackers from embedding across multiple cloud services.. A CNAPP aims to fix this by combining disparate cloud security functions (e.g. CSPM, CWPP, KSPM, CIEM, IaC) into one proprietary software solution, offering a platform-level view of the entire attack surface. CNAPP configurations can also include infrastructure-as-code automation, which allows for earlier discovery of faulty code and misconfigurations in the CI/CD pipeline. In other words, it grants DevOps teams greater visibility, ease of control, and speed in resolving cloud security issues as they emerge.. How to deploy a CNAPP. So, let’s say you’ve decided to invest in a CNAPP. What do you need to keep in mind to get the most out of it? Consider the purpose of deploying a CNAPP: It is designed for consolidating cloud security and reducing complexities in the management of security tools. With that in mind, there are several important items that security leaders should consider as they identify a CNAPP that works for their cloud needs.. Checklist for deploying a CNAPP. #1: Strategize before diving into the deep end. Before pulling the trigger, organizations should consider how a CNAPP will work for their business needs.. Do they have a hybrid cloud model that spans on-premise, private, and public cloud environments?. Do they have contingencies for securing all (not just some) artifacts across the dev cycle, including source code, containers, VM files, IaC scripts, APIs and cloud configuration files?. Will they need to shift responsibilities and feedback loops to accommodate the platform approach? The right CNAPP strategy should be flexible in addressing instances across all these spaces and more. It’s worth taking time to understand how a CNAPP might reveal gaps in the architecture and what needs to be done to address them.. #2: Be clear in communicating to vendors your requirements. As the CNAPP market is still relatively young, it’s worth negotiating one to two year contracts with a vendor in case new features become available elsewhere. Gartner recommends requiring CNAPP vendors to only charge for licenses-based modules that your team actually uses, rather than jumping all in on the full set of integrated capabilities (as the latter could take several years to fully adopt). Organizations can also require that vendors scan containers already in development and provide features like infrastructure-as-code scanning, Kubernetes security posture management, and runtime assessment using APIs to get the most bang for their buck.. #3: Keep the focus and the priority on developers. A CNAPP can help developers create a more secure environment with better visibility. However, implementing new technology may still present some challenges. Taking a platform approach to cloud-native security could necessitate a shift in how teams work together, structure and report their findings, and configure and test new features. Organizations should provide time and resources for devs to familiarize themselves with the CNAPP’s offerings, such as improved threat scanning, the ability to automate cloud configurations, and proactive controls for fixing code in development rather than at runtime. A CNAPP can shift team responsibilities and structures. Organizations should clarify and communicate these changes with developers to ensure smooth adoption of the platform.. #4: Treat security and compliance as a continuum from development to production. The added value of a CNAPP includes consolidated insights from the development lifecycle. By integrating solutions, a CNAPP platform builds shared context for security and development teams to analyze for future improvements. Unifying functions, tools and oversight into a single platform gives DevSecOps greater visibility throughout the development process. With infrastructure-as-code automation, a CNAPP platform helps developers see and correct problems before they lead to an incident. Overall, this results in fewer bugs and more expedient production.</td>\n",

Natus recommended installing the update, NeuroWorks/SleepWorks 8.5 GMA 3, “as quickly as possible on affected systems.”. The NeuroWorks software uses a SQL server database, which enables collaboration between multiple users while also providing customization capabilities to fit any clinical configuration. The software enables remote access to the Xltek EEG device and video monitoring and review, as well as running, analyzing, reporting on, and managing an EEG study using an intuitive user interface.. Dig Deeper. Medical Device Security Should Be Focus for Healthcare Providers. Medical Device Cybersecurity Top Challenge to IoT Ecosystem. Medical Devices Reportedly Infected in Ransomware Attack. Cory Duplantis of Cisco Talos discovered the vulnerabilities and reported them to Natus.. In a blog post, Paul Rascagneres of Cisco Talos explained that the company identified code execution vulnerabilities and denial-of-service vulnerability in the NeuroWorks software. The vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely without authentication.. The Windows-based NeuroWorks software uses the hospital’s ethernet network to connect to EEG devices and integrate with patient information systems.. “Clinicians rely on accurate clinical data in order to decide what is the most appropriate care for their patients. Medical devices such as Natus Xltek EEG are a convenient tool for collecting and recording complex data relating to patients’ state of health,” explained Rascagneres.. “However, this captured clinical data is only as reliable as the platform on which it is collected. If the system collecting the data is liable to be compromised, then the care of the patients will also be compromised,” he noted.. Cisco Talos has observed attackers targeting the healthcare sector to deploy ransomware and steal confidential health care records.. ICS-CERT said that no known public exploits target these vulnerabilities.. National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) recommended that device end users take the following defensive measures:. • Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the internet. • Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. • Use secure methods for remote access, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most current version available, and are only as secure as the devices connected to them. NCCIC advised organizations to perform impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.. Earlier in June, ICS-CERT also issued an advisory about security vulnerabilities in Philips’ IntelliVue patient and Avalon fetal monitor.. The vulnerabilities could enable an attacker to read/write memory and induce a denial of service through a system restart, the advisory warned.. Oran Avraham of Medigate reported the Philips device vulnerabilities to NCCIC.. Philips said it will provide a remediation patch for supported versions of the devices, as well as an upgrade path for all versions. The company said it will communicate service options to all affected install-base users.. In its product security advisory, Philips said that the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited without an attacker first attaining local area network (LAN) access to the medical device.. Last month, ICS-CERT highlighted vulnerabilities in another Philips medical device, its Brilliance CT scanners. Those vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers to steal PHI and other sensitive data files.. The vulnerabilities affect the following Philips CT scanners: Brilliance 64 version 2.6.2 and below, Brilliance iCT versions 4.1.6 and below, Brilliance CT SP versions 3.2.4 and below, and Brilliance CT Big Bore 2.3.5 and below.. The security vulnerabilities include execution with unnecessary privileges, exposure of resources to wrong sphere, and use of hard-coded credentials. These security flaws could impact system confidentiality, system integrity, or system availability, the advisory noted.. The rash of medical device security flaws uncovered by security researchers has prompted the Food and Drug Administration to issue a medical device safety action plan to help reduce the vulnerabilities in legacy medical devices.. As part of those efforts, the FDA wants to set up a CyberMed Safety (Expert) Analysis Board, which would be a public-private partnership between the FDA and devices makers to complement existing device vulnerability coordination and response mechanisms..

Officials said in a statement that they will form a new U.S.-Israeli Task Force on Fintech Innovation and Cybersecurity.. As the global economy recovers and ransomware and other illicit finance threats present a grave challenge to Israel and the U.S., increased information exchanges, joint work, and collaboration on policy, regulation, and enforcement are critical to our economic and national security objectives, Adeyemo said.. Strategic alliances win wars, pure and simple, says Tim Wade, a former network and security technical manager with the U.S. Air Force. The U.S.-Israeli partnership against ransomware is not only welcome and likely to be productive, it's in the tradition of effective international partnerships.. Wade, currently the technical director and CTO at the firm Vectra AI, adds, Our efforts against cybercrime to date have been hampered by insufficient global alliances. Good ones devoted to other forms of criminal activity point the way toward better cybersecurity.. Yet it is also about optics - especially on the heels of the recent White House ransomware summit, says Rosa Smothers, a former Central Intelligence Agency threat analyst and technical intelligence officer.. This makes sense, but there is also likely a PR motivation, says Smothers, currently the senior vice president of cyber operations at the firm KnowBe4. She cites recent NSO Group headlines as potential motivation for Israel to strengthen ties with the U.S.. Memorandum of Understanding. U.S. Treasury Department officials said a yet-to-be-drafted memorandum of understanding between the two nations will cover the following:. Financial sector information sharing on regulations and guidance, and on threat intelligence;. Staff training, study visits and cross-border competency-building activities;. Technical exchanges on policy, regulation and outreach;. Improved public sector analytics and enforcement.. 'Valuable Partnerships'. Praising similar partnerships, Adam Flatley, a member of the U.S. Ransomware Task Force and a former technical lead for the National Security Agency, says these efforts will need to take different forms to be effective. Some, like this one, will be bilateral, he says. The U.S. and Israel have long worked closely and effectively together on critical security issues of common interest.. Flatley, currently the director of threat intelligence for the firm [redacted], adds, Others will be multilateral …. [but] all of these relationships are valuable and necessary in concert with a global coordinated campaign.. Israel is a strategic partner in this sector because it has long seen cybersecurity as a national security issue, says Marcus Fowler, a former department chief for the CIA and currently the director of strategic threat at the firm Darktrace. Israel is also highly advanced in applying new technologies and innovations.. File image of NSO Group. Developments With NSO Spyware. This month, the U.S. Department of Commerce added both NSO Group and fellow Israeli spyware company Candiru to its Entity List for allegedly engaging in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the U.S. A final rule from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security - or BIS - says the companies threatened the privacy and security of individuals and organizations worldwide. Those on the Entity List cannot purchase U.S. technologies or goods without a license provided by the Department of Commerce (see: US Commerce Department Blacklists Israeli Spyware Firms).. An NSO Group spokesperson previously told U.S. media that the company was dismayed by the decision, given that our technologies support U.S. national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime.. Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Yair Lapid later distanced the government from the NSO Group, which distributes its products under licenses from Israel's Defense Ministry, which is reportedly investigating the company's activities. NSO Group has said it sells its products to law enforcement and intelligence agencies for legitimate use.. NSO is a private company. It is not a governmental project and therefore, even if it is designated, it has nothing to do with the policies of the Israeli government, Lapid told reporters this month, according to Reuters.. Shalev Hulio, the co-founder and CEO of NSO Group, announced that he will remain in his position as CEO, following reports by Israeli media that its CEO-designate, Itzik Benbenisti, currently NSO's co-president, has resigned (see: NSO's Troubles Extend Beyond CEO-Designate Quitting).. Whole-of-Government Approach. Last week, the Treasury Department blacklisted cryptocurrency exchange Chatex, along with a network of entities it says support the exchange, for allegedly facilitating ransomware-related financial transactions (see: US Treasury Blacklists Cryptocurrency Exchange Chatex).. This followed the White House's counter-ransomware summit held last month - with attendance from more than 30 countries, including Israel. During the meeting, Adeyemo reportedly urged global action against the abuse of virtual currency used in ransomware transactions (see: US Convenes Global Ransomware Summit Without Russia).. And last week, Vice President Kamala Harris confirmed that the U.S. would be joining the Paris Call, an 80-nation cybersecurity pact established in 2018 by French President Emmanuel Macron to develop international cybersecurity norms (see: VP Kamala Harris: US Will Join 80-Nation Cybersecurity Pact).. Recapping her meeting with Macron, Harris told reporters last week, We talked extensively … about what we as nations must do, who have similar values … to apply those principles and norms to how we will engage with each other … as it relates to our use of technology..

The United States cannot afford to sit by as our adversaries exploit our vulnerabilities,” the letter states. “Congress - especially the Senate - must enact a robust and bipartisan set of policies now. China, Iran, Russia, and nonstate actors are utilizing every means possible to manipulate our elections and undermine the faith Americans have in our democracy. These efforts pose severe threats to our national security.”. The legislation the letter endorses includes:. The Secure Elections Act, which seeks to bolster voting systems while reaffirming each state’s role in administering federal elections;. The Honest Ads Act, which backers say would help protect against hidden, foreign propaganda efforts online.. The Foreign Agents Disclosure and Registration Enhancement Act, which is designed to modernize and enforce lobbying laws and impose meaningful penalties for rule breakers;. The Shell Company Abuse Act, which backers say would help ensure foreign actors cannot hide behind tax laws to subvert elections;. The Defending Elections from Threats by Establishing Redlines (DETER) Act, which would impose sanctions on countries that interfere in American elections. ”In addition to action on these five important bills, Congress should ensure that states and counties have the additional financial support they need to address election vulnerabilities, coupled with minimum standards and requirements to ensure election security and verifiability,” the letter states.. In recent days, Senate Democrats have tried to get votes on certain election security bills, but have been blocked by Republicans, who have argued, for example, that some of the legislation would give the federal government unprecedented control over elections, according to The Hill..

Meanwhile, yet another bill, the DOTGOV Online Trust in Government Act of 2019, was introduced Wednesday by senators James Lankford, R-Okla; Gary Peters, D-Mich; Ron Johnson, R-Wisc.; and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn... The bill aims to strengthen local governments' cybersecurity defenses by enabling them to switch to thegov domain for websites and email addresses. The measure is an attempt to make it more difficult for cybercriminals to impersonate government officials for phishing and other identity-theft related scams.. When official government websites use thegov domain instead of alternatives likeus orcom, it makes those government websites and email addresses more secure,” Klobuchar says. “Unfortunately, right now most county and local governments don’t use thegov domain. This allows cybercriminals to more easily impersonate government officials in order to defraud the public and get people to share sensitive information.

              "      <td>The Department of Justice indicted two Iranian hackers behind the targeted and highly successful SamSam ransomware campaign that has plagued the healthcare sector for several years.. The federal prosecutors charged Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri and Faramarz Shahi Savandi for an extortion scheme that targeted a wide range of organizations, especially the healthcare sector.. Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski explained the hackers were responsible for some of the biggest hacks on the healthcare sector in the last two years: Allscripts, medical testing giant LabCorp, Washington, DC-based MedStar Health, Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital, Hancock Health and a host of others.. Dig Deeper. 2.65M Atrium Health Patient Records Breached in Third-Party Vendor Hack. HealthEquity Email Hack Breaches Data of 190K Patients. Phishing Attacks Breach Data of 42K Florida Patients for 3 Months. The notorious SamSam variant has been actively targeting the healthcare sector and the government since 2016. DOJ officials allege the most recent ransomware attack took place on Sept. 25, 2018.. The hackers primarily use brute force attacks on Remote Desktop Services to gain access onto a victim’s system. They’d use the RDP as an entry point onto a system to then infect other computers on the network. The defendants would also mask attacks to appear like legitimate network activity.. Further, the hackers purposefully launched attacks outside of regular business hours, “when a victim would find it more difficult to mitigate the attack, and by encrypting backups on the victims’ computers.”. “This was intended to -- and often did -- cripple the regular business operations of the victims,” according to the indictment.. Their ransom demands ranged from $5,000 to $60,000, depending on the attack size. While typically ransomware attacks are random, SamSam hackers leveraged a targeted and manual nature and heavily researched victims before launching an attack.. The method proved successful as the hacking group banked at least $6 million in ransom payments and caused more than $30 million in damages for its 200 victims.. “The allegations in the indictment unsealed today -- the first of its kind – outline an Iran-based international computer hacking and extortion scheme that engaged in 21st-century digital blackmail,” Benczkowski said in a statement.. “The defendants in this case developed and deployed the SamSam Ransomware in order to hold public and private entities hostage and then extort money from them,” U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Craig Carpenito said in a statement.. The hackers began by targeting a Mercer County business, then moved to public entities like the city of Newark and specifically healthcare providers including Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita and the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, Carpenito explained.. In fact, DOJ officials allege the hackers targeted healthcare as the organizations rely on data to serve the public without interruption.. “By calling out those who threaten American systems, we expose criminals who hide behind their computer and launch attacks that threaten our public safety and national security,” FBI Executive Assistant Director said in a statement.. “The actions highlighted today, which represent a continuing trend of cybercriminal activity emanating from Iran, were particularly threatening, as they targeted public safety institutions, including U.S. hospital systems and governmental entities,” she added.. DOJ charged Savandi and Mansouri with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers, two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer and two substantive counts of transmitting a demand in relation to damaging a protected computer.. The indictment is not an admission of guilt and the two hackers are still at large. In a separate announcement, the Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions against two bitcoin addresses connected to SamSam. The two addresses processed over 7,000 ransom demands from its victims.. Savandi and Mansouri are still wanted by the FBI, so it’s yet to be seen if the SamSam attacks will continue. However, the indictment sheds light on some of the biggest healthcare breaches in recent years..  Data Breaches Protected Health Information Ransomware.</td>\n",
