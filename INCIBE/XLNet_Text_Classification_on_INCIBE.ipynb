In a letter addressed to Senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), who first introduced the PATCH Act, the AHA said that the association and its members were committed to preventing cyberattacks and would support the PATCH Act’s intentions of doing the same via medical device security improvements.. “We are pleased to support this legislation to improve the security of medical devices, which can create cyber vulnerabilities and serious risks to the security and privacy of patient data along with vital medical technology used in care delivery,” the letter stated.. Dig Deeper. GAO Calls on HHS to Improve Healthcare Data Breach Reporting Process. Senators Call on FTC to Investigate Apple, Google’s “Deceptive” Data Privacy Practices. CISA Alerts Healthcare Sector to OFFIS DCMTK Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities. “Cyber vulnerabilities in medical devices, often containing outdated legacy technology, have posed a significant cyber risk to hospitals.”. The AHA pointed to the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack and “scores of foreign-based ransomware attacks” targeting the US healthcare sector since then that have threatened patient safety and medical device operability.. If passed, the PATCH Act would enable the implementation of critical cybersecurity requirements for medical device manufacturers applying for premarket approval through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The act would also require manufacturers to design, develop, and maintain updates and patches throughout the lifecycle of their devices.. Manufacturers would also be required to create a plan for addressing postmarket cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a timely manner. In addition, manufacturers would be tasked with creating a software bill of materials (SBOM) for their product and its components.. “Manufacturers should be accountable for developing products with appropriate security controls, as well as updating devices as cyber threats continue to evolve. We also encourage the inclusion of a provision to clarify that FDA approval of devices would not be jeopardized as manufacturers provide these updates,” the letter continued.. “Great strides have been made by hospitals and health systems to defend provider networks, secure patient data, preserve health care delivery and, most importantly, protect patient safety.”. The industry’s reliance on legacy devices and systems, challenges with keeping track of all medical devices on a hospital’s network, and the increasing severity of cyber threats have posed significant medical device security challenges.. As the bill makes its way through the legislative process, healthcare organizations should be proactive in taking steps to secure medical devices, create an inventory, and apply patches and updates as necessary.

              "      <td>As market fluctuations continue, the Federal Reserve is watching. On Tuesday, the Fed announced it was holding down interest rates.. Upon the news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced back, up 429 points from its more than 600-point plummet on Monday. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 4.7 percent and trading for Bank of America and Citigroup saw upticks of about 13 percent.. But industry pundits such as Tim Ghriskey, chief information officer at wealth strategy and asset-management firm Solaris Group LLC, say it's just too early for the Fed to make a call on what the long-term impact on the economy and U.S. financial institutions will be. [See Market Collapse Worst Since '08.]. We're really talking about investor sentiment and investor psychology at this point, Ghriskey says.. Doug Johnson, vice president of risk management policy for the American Bankers Association, says alarmist reactions would do bankers more harm than good. The market fluctuation was one day in time. I don't think it's going to have a long-term impact, he says.. Johnson also points out that, despite overall dips in share prices, banking institutions are not expected to decrease investments in fraud prevention. I don't think there's any connection between the market fluctuations and the investments banks will make in fraud prevention, he says. It's not about making budget cuts; it's about protecting the customer relationship and ensuring security. Banks know we need to be very careful how we protect customers.. Mike Mancusi, managing director at FTI Consulting and former senior deputy controller with the Office of the Comptroller, says banks will closely analyze mandates versus what's deemed good practice or a nice-to-have.. I suspect they're going to look at when they'll have to spend or make certain investments, Mancusi says. Some of the spend will be deferred until things improve. Again, I think anytime banks have to comply with something, they're going to spend to comply. If it's something that enhances their practice, in difficult times, they'll defer that spending.. When it comes to complying with the new FFIEC Authentication Guidance, Mancusi says spending for fraud-prevention could be affected. The FFIC guidance is there to tell you how to manage or address a particular area, he says. But during an examination, if you're in compliance, you're not going to be cited for a violation of an act or a safety practice, unless one exists outside the guidance.. In light of tightened budgets, how banks might balance fraud-prevention investments with investments in anti-money-laundering solutions that help them comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act, for instance, is difficult to estimate.. But Julie McNelley, a fraud and financial services analyst at Aite, says making generalizations about future fraud investments is risky.. Each bank's environment is unique, and it really depends on where they feel the internal need is the greatest, she says. All things being equal, I would give a slight edge to fraud-prevention technologies, particularly those that can provide a revenue-augmentation component. A fraud-prevention technology can provide an improvement to the customer experience, through reduced false-negatives, or through the opportunity to deploy new products. This is a powerful business case component any time, but particularly so in times of recession.. Long-Term Effects. Mancusi says gauging the long-term impact of current market fluctuations is difficult. Besides, this market plunge is different than the one the market felt Sept. 29, 2008, when Dow stocks dropped 778 points, the S&amp;P fell 60 points and the NASDAQ dropped 137 points.. The financial institutions have taken a real beating. They are definitely being hit hard in the market, he says. I don't know that this market is necessarily going to cause more banks to fail, though, because the things that are going on in the market are not the typical bank-lending activities that led to the number of failures we saw a few years ago. This is something that is dealing with what S&amp;P says about the debt rating in the U.S.. More bank failures are coming, but they would have come regardless of whether the market took a plunge. The FDIC has a considerable list of problem banks, Mancusi says. I think we'll see more failures, and the FDIC selling the deposits and some of the assets to stronger institutions.. Johnson says the market fluctuations should encourage core processors to offer more fraud-prevention solutions and measures that are linked to AML. [See AML Case Study: New Way to Fight Fraud.]. There's a clearly a need to do that, and it does affect the cost if those two are together, he says.. McNelley adds that nothing is ever exempt from budgetary cuts, of course, but says there will be increasing pressure on all vendors to prove their worth, whether they are incumbent or new solutions.. The bar for new business cases also rises during times of recession, as IT resources are typically even more constrained than they are during the positive economic times, McNelley says. Fraud-prevention vendors will need to show their ability to provide a solid ROI, and if they can also show how their solution can help minimize false-negatives, thus improving the customer experience, that can be a powerful way to help prioritize their business case versus others competing for shared resources.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Graham Ivan Clark , who is now 18, pleaded guilty to 30 felony charges stemming from a worldwide Twitter hack during which he gained access to celebrity Twitter accounts by tricking several Twitter employees into sharing needed admin credentials.. Clark used this access to post a tweet on 45 of the accounts asking for donations of $1,000 in bitcoin. The note said anyone sending the money would be sent $2,000 in return. This resulted in about $118,000 being stolen from 360 people, the state attorney's office in Tampa, Florida, says.. He took over the accounts of famous people, but the money he stole came from regular, hardworking people, says Andrew Warren, the state attorney in Florida's 13th Judicial District, who prosecuted the case. Graham Clark needs to be held accountable for that crime, and other potential scammers out there need to see the consequences.. By agreeing to the deal, Clark was sentenced as a juvenile under Florida's Youthful Offender Act, with the seven months he has already spent in jail being counted against the sentence. He was originally charged as an adult. If Clark violates the terms of his three-year probation, he will face a 10-year sentence in an adult prison, prosecutors say.. The Scam. Clark was arrested on July 30, 2020 - when he was 17 years old - for conducting the campaign that allowed him to gain access to 130 Twitter accounts, including those of now President Joe Biden, Bill Gates and Elon Musk.. Using social engineering techniques, Clark conducted a multistep telephone scam against several Twitter employees to obtain the admin-level credentials needed for accessing the internal support tools available to only a few employees that would allow him to take over the celebrity accounts, Twitter said in a report issued last year.. On July 15, 2020, Clark used the stolen admin tool to access Twitter's internal system and formally took control of the accounts, Warren says. Posing as account owner, he posted messages on 45 accounts with the same theme:. Bill Gates' verified Twitter account was hijacked for a cryptocurrency scam. (Source: SeekingAlpha). About 360 people fell for the crytocurrency scam, sending in 12.86 bitcoin, which equaled $117,440 at the time, Warren says. Law enforcement authorities seized the money, and it will be returned to its owners, the prosecutor says.. The Co-Conspirators. Two alleged co-conspirators also charged in connection to the July 2020 hack are Nima Fazeli, aka Rolex, 22, of Orlando, and U.K. resident Mason Sheppard, aka Chaewon, 19.. Fazeli was arrested and charged with aiding and abetting the intentional access of a protected computer. Sheppard was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and the intentional access of a protected computer, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, which is overseeing the federal prosecutions.. Court documents dated Feb. 1 state Fazeli and prosecutors are negotiating a potential resolution of the case. A hearing on the matter was set for March 8, but at this time, no other information from the Justice Department is available.. Fazeli's lawyers did not immediately reply to a request for an update on his case.. Sheppard's case is still pending.</td>\n",

The domain used to host some of the data is registered to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, says Hossein Jazi, a senior threat researcher with Malwarebytes, and Jérôme Segura, director of threat intelligence for the security firm.. Starts With Phishing. The Malwarebytes researchers say the attack kicks off with a phishing scam that uses the subject line Your Right to Compensation. The email contains a zip file that hosts a document labeled Compensation manual.doc.. The document says it is encrypted and requests that the victim enable editing. When this is done, the victim is taken to a website where the fileless malware is loaded into the Windows Error Reporting system, according to the report.. The attackers use the Windows Error Reporting service because that makes the attack more difficult to detect, according to Malwarebytes. Werfault.exe, the Windows Error Reporting process of Windows 10, is used to report errors. If any application or hardware crashes in a device, then Werfault.exe makes it possible to forward the crash report to Microsoft, the researchers note.. Inside [the document] we see a malicious macro that uses a modified version of CactusTorch VBA module to execute its shellcode. CactusTorch is leveraging the DotNetToJscript technique to load aNet compiled binary into memory and execute it from vbscript, the Malwarebytes researchers say.. The use of CactusTorch is another indicator APT32 may be behind the campaign because the group is known to use that VBA module to drop variants of the Denis remote access Trojan, according to Malwarebytes.. However, since we were not able to get the final payload we cannot definitely attribute this attack to APT32, the researchers say (see: Vietnamese APT Group Targets BMW, Hyundai: Report).. Kraken Loader. The loaded payload is aNET Dynamic Link Library with Kraken.dll as its internal name, researchers say.. This DLL is a loader that injects an embedded shellcode into WerFault.exe. To be clear, this is not the first case of such a technique. It was observed before with the NetWire RAT and even the Cerber ransomware, Segura and Jazi note.. The researchers report that the loader has two main classes - Kraken and Loader. Kraken contains the shellcode that gets injected into the target process defined in this class as WerFault.exe.. It only has one function that calls the Load function of Loader class with shellcode and target process as parameters. Whereas, the Loader class is responsible for injecting shellcode into the target process by making Windows API calls, the researchers note.. Anti-Analysis Checks. To perform anti-analysis checks, the hackers created multiple threads to make sure the fileless malware is not running in a sandbox environment or in a debugger. Researchers first checked the existence of a debugger by calling GetTickCount, which is a timing function that is used to measure the time needed to execute some instruction sets.. The Malwarebytes researchers note: In this thread, it is being called two times before and after a sleep instruction and then the difference is being calculated. If it is not equal to 2, the program exits, as it identifies it is being debugged.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The Healthcare &amp; Public Health Sector Coordinating Councils (HSCC) published model contract language to help healthcare organizations ensure medical device security when crafting contracts with device manufacturers.. Mayo Clinic, Premier Inc., and Siemens Healthineers led the drafting process intending to deliver a template to help healthcare organizations and medical technology companies navigate and create cybersecurity contractual terms and conditions.. The need for a contract template stemmed from ongoing complications between healthcare organizations and medical device manufacturers (MDMs) regarding responsibility, accountability, and varying cybersecurity expectations.. Dig Deeper. 7 New Vulnerabilities Threaten Supply Chain, Medical Device Security. BD Discloses Viper, Pyxis Medical Device Vulnerabilities. Healthcare IoT, Medical Device Vulnerability Disclosures Skyrocket. “These factors have introduced and sustained ambiguities in cybersecurity and accountability between MDM’s and [healthcare organizations] that historically have been reconciled at best inconsistently in the purchase contract negotiation process, leading to downstream disputes and potential patient safety implications,” an accompanying press release explained.. To ensure adequate security measures, the contract template includes language that articulates compliance and security requirements surrounding how healthcare organizations and MDMs store, transfer, or access medical devices and network-connected solutions.. HSCC noted that the contract template is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and organizations will have to modify some aspects during contract negotiations to align with their needs. The guide is meant to serve as a scalable template for organizations of any size.. The HSCC Model Contract Language task group attributed some miscommunications between healthcare organizations and MDMs to inconsistent contract terminology. The group suggested that the inconsistent language ultimately led to cybersecurity responsibility and accountability ambiguities in the past.. MDMs and healthcare organizations are linked by HIPAA business associate agreements (BAAs), which subject vendors with protected health information (PHI) access to the same security standards as HIPAA-covered entities.. The model contract language can serve as a standalone agreement or as an addendum to a BAA, a Master Service Agreement (MSA), or a Requests for Proposals (RFP).. HSCC organized the model contract framework into three key cybersecurity pillars: performance, maturity, and product design maturity. The task group organized contract clauses into fourteen core principles within these pillars.. As with any business associate, healthcare organizations are responsible for ensuring that the vendor has implemented adequate security standards before entrusting them with PHI. Organizations must conduct regular risk assessments and implement technical safeguards to prevent cyberattacks and data breaches.. This is especially apparent with medical devices, which are notorious for being difficult to manage from a cybersecurity perspective due to their mobility and the number of legacy devices that cannot be patched.. Medical devices are often the subject of severe vulnerability disclosures. A recent report by Unit 42 found that 75 percent of 200,000 analyzed infusion pumps contained known security gaps. Claroty also found that healthcare IoT, IT, and medical device vulnerability disclosures have increased exponentially over the last four years.. BD disclosed severe vulnerabilities in some of its BD Pyxis and BD Viper LT products in early March. Separately, Forescout’s global research team discovered seven vulnerabilities, known as Access:7, that impact the PTC Axeda agent and could result in supply chain and medical device security issues.. These recent disclosures underscore the need for consistent communication and thorough contract language between healthcare organizations and medical device manufacturers.. The model contract language included considerations about vulnerability management, security patch validation, and incident response management, among other core principles.. “Medical device manufacturers, health delivery organizations, and group purchasing organizations are encouraged to closely review this contract language and adopt as much as is appropriate for the organization,” the press release continued.. “The more uniformity and predictability the sector can achieve in cross enterprise cybersecurity management expectations, the greater strides it will make toward patient safety and a more secure and resilient healthcare system.”.

              "      <td>The White House says the program is part of a broader cybersecurity plan designed to address issues across the nation's critical infrastructure.. The 100-day initiative will involve government agencies that are responsible for the security of critical infrastructure as well as businesses and private utilities that oversee or own infrastructure, such as electrical distribution systems that deliver power to homes.. Public-private partnership is paramount to the administration's efforts because protecting our nation's critical infrastructure is a shared responsibility of government and the owners and operators of that infrastructure, says Emily Horne, a spokesperson for the National Security Council.. Some lawmakers and a government watchdog agency have recently criticized the Department of Energy for its cybersecurity practices, especially in the wake of the SolarWinds supply chain attack, which led to follow-on attacks on the DOE and eight other federal agencies, plus 100 companies.. In March, the Government Accountability Office released a report that found the U.S. electrical grid's distribution systems, which deliver electricity directly to customers, are increasingly vulnerable to cyberthreats and urged the Energy Department to incorporate these systems into its cybersecurity plans (see: GAO: Electrical Grid's Distribution Systems More Vulnerable).. Some security experts have criticized President Joe Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure spending proposal for lacking cybersecurity specifics, including security enhancements for the nation's electrical grid. Others analysts, however, noted that any improvements in infrastructure would likely strengthen security by updating and replacing older equipment (see: Biden's Infrastructure Plan: 3 Cybersecurity Provisions).. Security Improvements. As part of the 100-day plan for the nation's electrical grid, the Energy Department's Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, or CESER, will work with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and private utilities to make a series of cybersecurity improvements.. The goals of the project include:. Encouraging owners and operators of power plants and facilities to enhance security incident detection, mitigation, response and forensic capabilities;. Deploying technologies to allow for real-time situational awareness within industrial control systems and operational technology networks;. Reinforcing the IT networks and infrastructure used within facilities;. Deploying technologies to increase the visibility of threats within ICS and OT systems.. The Energy Department also is seeking suggestions from electric utilities, energy companies, academia, research laboratories, government agencies and others for improving supply chain security within U.S. energy systems.. Modernization. While the emphasis on protecting and shoring up cybersecurity around the nation's electrical grid is long overdue, updating and improving complex OT and ICS systems will be a time-consuming process, says Austin Berglas, who formerly was an assistant special agent in charge of cyber investigations at the FBI's New York office.. Operational technology - or computing systems used to manage industrial operations opposed to administrative actions - often rely on outdated, unprotected systems that were not manufactured with security in mind, says Berglas, who is now global head of professional services at cybersecurity firm BlueVoyant. In many instances, this will require a complete transformation of process and technology. There will need to be a significant investment in resources, both human and capital, to bring many energy companies up to a higher standard of cybersecurity.. Padraic O'Reilly, co-founder and chief product officer of CyberSaint Security, also notes that when making changes and updates to ICS and OT systems, the federal government is in a unique position to help private organizations focus on what needs to be modernized.. With so much of the infrastructure privatized and in need of modernization, it can be difficult to get everyone pulling in the same direction, and the Department of Energy and CISA can really help with this, O'Reilly says.. Growing Concerns. Lawmakers are growing more concerned about cyberthreats facing the nation's electrical grid, including from nation-state attackers and others.. In March, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators sent a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm demanding that the DOE place a greater emphasis on cybersecurity as part of strategic planning and that the new administration keep the leadership of CESER in place to better respond to threats (see: Senators Raise Concerns About Energy Dept. Cybersecurity).. At a recent U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, about China's ability to use cyber tools to disrupt natural gas pipelines and Russia's ability to interfere with the U.S. electrical grid (see: Senators Push for Changes in Wake of SolarWinds Attack).. Nakasone acknowledged that China and Russia have continued to improve their cyber capabilities and noted that the U.S. government is looking to strengthen its defenses for critical infrastructure.</td>\n",

              "      <td>In their letter to Blinken dated Sept. 22, Cotton and Gallagher, who is a member of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, say Huawei's cloud services run in more than 40 countries, providing potential system access to the CCP. This includes projects in countries of immense geopolitical importance to the U.S., such as Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, they say.. The GOP lawmakers echo ongoing security and privacy concerns related to the telecom giant and cite a nearly 170% revenue increase for Huawei's cloud offerings in 2020. This undermines U.S. efforts to curtail [its] power, influence and financial strength, they add.. The lawmakers ask Blinken to outline the department's related actions/plans, including efforts to prevent other governments from adopting Huawei technologies, and similarly, whether alternatives can be presented in those cases.. Both the U.S. Department of State and Huawei could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. Huawei has previously denied allegations that it poses a national security threat.. Assisting China's MSS?. The international threat to data and integrity posed by Huawei extends far beyond 5G, Cotton and Gallagher say in the letter this week. They cite an alleged incident of China reportedly spying on the African Union headquarters through Huawei-made cameras it installed in 2012 - alongside the AU's information and computer systems. The lawmakers claim China installed backdoors in the systems and reportedly obtained sensitive information. Huawei has denied the allegations.. If allowed to proliferate, Huawei's cloud services could give the Chinese Communist Party similar access to additional governments, companies, and other important institutions, the GOP lawmakers write.. Rosa Smothers, a former technical intelligence officer and cyber threat analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, tells Information Security Media Group that China's National Intelligence Law, enacted in 2017, created legal responsibilities for Chinese companies to provide access, cooperation or support for Beijing's intelligence collection needs.. Noting that, Smothers, the senior vice president of operations at the security firm KnowBe4, says, Huawei and other Chinese companies that can serve as a force multiplier for the Ministry of State Security will do so.. E-Government Services. Cotton and Gallagher contend that Huawei Cloud's e-Government services, which streamline digitization, tax services, national ID systems and elections, may expose its clients to the prying eyes of the CCP.. They add, When Huawei's client is a country, its entire population and political structure sits in the crosshairs.. The threat, they add, could lead to CCP access to the personal data of visiting U.S. citizens, service members, businesspersons and diplomats.. Our FCC designated Huawei as a national security threat last year, and I expect the [current] administration will maintain that stance, KnowBe4's Smothers says. But anything we can do to dissuade other countries from leveraging Huawei's cloud products is better not just for our national security but the security of the 40 countries where these cloud services are currently in use.. U.S. Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., co-author of a Huawei letter to the Department of State (Photo: Gage Skidmore via Flickr). 'Clean Network' Program. Cotton and Gallagher also address the Clean Network program launched by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Undersecretary of State Keith Krach, which they say helps address the long-term threat [that] malign authoritarian actors pose to data privacy, security and democratic values. They press Blinken on whether the program will proceed during the Biden administration.. The alliance of democracies yielded digital trust and democratic values commitments from more than 60 countries and 200 telecom companies, among others, after its launch in 2020. At the time, it was a departure from then-President Donald Trump's America First economic strategy.. We must combat Huawei as a whole and target each of the company's commercial units, including their 5G, cloud services, mobile-phone, and underwater cable businesses, the letter's authors maintain.. Sanctions. In the National Defense Authorization Act for 2019, the U.S. banned federal use of equipment from Huawei and fellow Chinese telecom company ZTE. In May 2019, the Department of Commerce added Huawei to its Entity List for its dealings with the Iranian government, restricting U.S. companies from doing business with the multinational giant without a special license.. Additionally, in 2020, the U.S. extended its ban to include semiconductors. And in June of that year, the Federal Communications Commission officially classified Huawei as a national security threat and later prohibited approvals of Huawei equipment in U.S. telecom networks.. In July, the FCC finalized a $1.9 billion plan that will assist smaller, rural telecom carriers in paying to rip and replace Huawei and ZTE technologies from their networks.. Also in July, Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Cotton, looked to place additional restrictions on the use of telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE by introducing a still-pending bill that prohibits the use of funds from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan stimulus package to buy such equipment (see: Senate Bill Proposes Further Restrictions on Huawei, ZTE).</td>\n",

Increasing scientific knowledge is the ultimate goal of data sharing. However, it is essential that the public also trusts that the data sharing is being done in a secure way, the report stated. There are significant risks, burdens, and challenges that accompany data sharing. That is why IOM formed a committee “to develop guiding principles and a practical framework for the responsible sharing of clinical trial data.”. “Policies for granting access to data should be in the service of several goals — protecting the privacy of participants; reducing risk of invalid analyses or misuse; avoiding undue burdens on data users and harm to investigators and sponsors; and enhancing public trust in clinical trial data sharing,” the committee members stated in the report.. The IOM report also explained how the the timing of data sharing should balance three separate goals:. Consumer Health Privacy Violated Online, Says New Study. Legal experts examine future HIPAA audits, OCR guidance. Despite Microsoft Patch, Attacks Using WannaCry Exploit on the Rise. 1. allow a fair opportunity for clinical trialists to publish results before secondary investigators gain access to the data;. 2. allow secondary investigators to access unpublished trial data after a fair period has passed or reproduce the findings of a published analysis; and. 3. protect the commercial interests of sponsors in gaining regulatory approval for a product so that they receive fair financial rewards for their investment.. Moreover, the IOM report stated that while it is important for clinical analysts to have enough time after a trial has finished to go over all data, the analysis period should not exceed 18 months.. “When that period has passed — regardless of whether the trial results have been published — the IOM committee finds that the scientific process is best served by allowing other investigators to access the data,” the committee explained.. Also, when trial findings are published before the end of those 18 months, the committee recommended that the supporting analytic dataset be shared within six months of publication. As systems for “responsible data sharing” continue to evolve, the committee said that it hoped that simultaneous sharing would soon become the norm.. “Greater data sharing could enhance public well-being by accelerating the drug discovery and development process, reducing redundant research, and facilitating scientific innovation. Before these benefits can be realized, however, stakeholders must confront significant risks and challenges,” the committee members wrote.. The IOM committee is not the only group investigating the benefits of health data sharing. 23andMe partnered with Pfizer last week to further the use of health data sharing for genetic research purposes. The two companies plan to collaborate on certain genome-wide association studies, surveys, and clinical trial recruitment.. Many consumers are also willing to share their health data, if it is done anonymously and in a secure way, according to a recent NPR-Truven Health Analytics Poll. In terms of drug/pharma researchers, 87 percent of respondents stated that they were comfortable sharing their data anonymously. The number was even higher of government researchers were asking for health information – 92 percent stated they were fine with anonymous health data sharing..

NIST solicited feedback and position papers from the community to settle on a reasonable definition.. The executive order also directs the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to use the “critical software” definition to create a list of categories of software that might fall under the first phase of the executive order’s implementation. NIST proposed a phased implementation approach to give the government and software industry time to secure the supply chain of critical software.. In a white paper released on June 25th, a day before the EO’s official deadline, NIST explains that “One of the goals of the EO is to assist in developing a security baseline for critical software products used across the Federal Government. The designation of software as EO-critical will then drive additional activities, including how the Federal Government purchases and manages deployed critical software.”. Dig Deeper. NIST Releases Draft of Ransomware Risk Management Framework. NIST Unveils Guide to Mobile Device Authentication for First Responders. NIST IoT Guidance for Network-Based Attacks, Device Communication. NIST uses the term “EO-critical” to differentiate between the common usage of the word “critical” and avoid any confusion. The official definition states:. EO-critical software is defined as any software that has, or has direct software dependencies upon, one or more components with at least one of these attributes:. is designed to run with elevated privilege or manage privileges;. has direct or privileged access to networking or computing resources;. is designed to control access to data or operational technology;. performs a function critical to trust; or,. operates outside of normal trust boundaries with privileged access.. NIST recommends that the first EO implementation phase focus on on-site standalone software that has security functions and the potential to be compromised. Future phases will tackle cloud-based software, software development tools, software components in operational technology (OT), and software that controls data access.. The paper provides a lengthy list of EO-critical software, along with descriptions, types of products, and rationale for the inclusion of each category of software. Categories include endpoint security, remote scanning, and identity, credential, and access management (ICAM), among others. This list is just a head start, and CISA will issue the finalized list in the near future.. NIST’s work contributes to the executive order’s main goal of managing risks to the cyber supply chain within the federal government. While private companies will not be required to follow NIST’s software supply chain guidelines, it is strongly recommended. Companies that sell to the federal government will need to comply with the government’s software supply chain practices.. Biden’s executive order contained a long list of tasks for NIST with deadlines extending into 2022. By July 11th, NIST will publish guidance outlining critical software security measures, and guidance on the minimum standards for the testing of a vendor’s source code.. Outside of it is executive order duties, NIST recently released a preliminary draft of its ransomware risk management framework, which aims to help organizations respond to ransomware attacks. The draft identifies crucial steps to maintaining cybersecurity, including using antivirus software, restricting the use of personal devices at the workplace, and keeping computers up to date..

CertiK credits much of the growth in digital currencies to the rise of Binance Smart Chain, whose total value locked, or TVL, grew from $62 million to $21 billion in 2021 - a 31,000% increase, the firm says.. But the rise of DeFi protocols - which do not rely on traditional intermediaries and instead run on peer-to-peer smart contracts across decentralized apps, or DApps - has made the reward for successful exploits even greater, CertiK says. And increased interoperability, it says, has opened up new attack vectors.. According to DeFi Pulse, which tracks related investments, DeFi had $95 billion in TVL at the time of writing.. Centralization and Other Risks. CertiK researchers, who audited more than 1,700 projects, say the most common vulnerability detected across DeFi protocols was centralization risk, in which a single actor controls multiple addresses. CertiK encountered 286 discrete centralization risks across the 1,737 audits performed in 2021. It says: Centralization is antithetical to the ethos of DeFi and poses major security risks. Single points of failure can be exploited by dedicated hackers and malicious insiders alike.. Other common vulnerabilities included 211 instances of mission event emissions, or functions that should emit notifications to users when sensitive variables or important processes are changed. CertiK also cites the use of an unlocked compiler version, detected in 176 instances, which can lead to differences in bytecode.. CertiK came across 104 lines of code lacking proper input validation - or inputs that limit the functionality of an executable to a set of known possibilities.. The firm warned against a reliance on third-party dependencies, which it detected in 102 cases. It writes: A developer can only control the security of their own code, not that of the external contracts with which theirs interact.. Offering a similar warning on DeFi security, Jennifer Fernick, a governing board member of The Linux Foundation’s Open Source Security Foundation, tells ISMG: One leaked cryptographic key or a single software flaw could lead to the collapse of entire organizations. I suspect that serious DeFi companies will, over time, more easily understand the intrinsic value of robust cybersecurity than their so-called 'web2' counterparts, mainly because for DeFi, 'code is law,' and there is so much at stake that can vanish in an instant.. Fernick, who is currently the global head of research at cybersecurity consulting firm NCC Group, says she expects to see a potentially unprecedented market-driven push for higher assurance systems for DeFi companies.. And Connie Lam, head of CertiK's Incident Response Team, tells ISMG that crypto markets are no doubt widening, and the need for cybersecurity is intensifying. Still, she says, We're entering a multi-chain world. … The real opportunity [moving forward] lies in efficiently maximizing opportunity across all chains.. Source: CertiK's The State of DeFi Security 2021 report. 'Security: A Foundational Concern'. Noting that Solidity - the language in which Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, smart contracts are written - is only seven years old, CertiK states, Developers are still exploring the possibilities of smart contract code, and there is no better time than these early days to make security a foundational concern and protect users well into the future.. The CertiK report says hasty forks, or chain-splits following protocol updates, unaudited deployments and outright scams resulted in significant losses. It says that Uranium Finance, a fork of Uniswap deployed on Binance Smart Chain, lost $57 million in user funds due to a single character in its source code.. Any changes to a platform's code should be reviewed and audited, no matter how small the initial modification is, the CertiK researchers say. As we've seen, a byte-sized piece of code can have multimillion-dollar ramifications.. Regulators Watching Closely. Citing a wide-scale increase in crypto adoption, the CertiK researchers also acknowledge that regulators have circled DeFi and the broader cryptocurrency market of late.. In China in 2021, regulators cracked down on cryptocurrency and cryptomining, resulting in an exodus of miners from the Chinese mainland.. In the U.S., under the leadership of new Chair Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly signaled potentially broader enforcement of securities laws to govern crypto markets.. On Aug. 3, 2021, Gensler called crypto markets rife with fraud, scams and abuse, and urged Congress to provide the SEC with additional authority to regulate the markets. Gensler also noted in August that DeFi projects are not immune to regulation - with features that warrant federal oversight (see: SEC to Monitor Illicit Activity on DeFi Platforms).. Outspoken critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also called for comprehensive regulation around cryptocurrencies - citing both security and market risks, including crypto's highly volatile nature.. Going forward, security will continue to be inextricably tied to the future of DeFi, the CertiK researchers say. Without meaningful security that protects users and secures platforms, innovation will suffer and interest will die off.. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell (Photo: Federalreserve via Flickr). Pending Legislation?. Elsewhere on the regulatory front, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed will be issuing its report on cryptocurrencies - including the feasibility of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC - in the coming weeks. Powell appeared for a hearing to be reconfirmed as Fed chair for four years.. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., tweeted on Tuesday that he intends to introduce legislation around digital currencies, but did not offer specifics. Last month, Sen. Cynthia Loomis, R-Wyo., a longtime crypto evangelist, announced that she too will introduce a bill that attempts to regulate the cryptocurrency space - including the creation of a self-regulatory body under the jurisdiction of the SEC and its sister agency, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (see: GOP Senator to Introduce 'Comprehensive' Crypto Regs Bill).. +++. [Update - Jan. 12, 6:15 p.m.]: On Wednesday, Emmer officially introduced a bill that would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC directly to individuals. In a statement, he said: Not only would this CBDC model centralize Americans' financial information, leaving it vulnerable to attack, but it could also be used as a surveillance tool. … Requiring users to open up an account at the Fed to access a U.S. CBDC would put the Fed on an insidious path akin to China's digital authoritarianism. The congressman said any CBDC must be accessible, transact on a transparent blockchain, and maintain the privacy elements of cash.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Impresa says that the websites of Expresso, SIC and the Blitz magazine are temporarily unavailable, impeding its ability to report news from Portugal. In its effort to recover from Sunday's cyberattack, the media group has launched a temporary website: Expresso.pt.. The Impresa group, in its statement, says that it is collaborating with authorities to resolve the situation at the earliest opportunity and guarantees delivery of its next weekly edition.. In the wake of the cyberattack, several readers and publications, such as CNN Portugal and Publico, expressed solidarity on Twitter and Facebook with Expresso's new motto #liberdadeparainformar, which translates to Freedom to Inform.. Online media outlet The Record reports that the Lapsus$ ransomware group has claimed responsibility for the attack that impacted Impresa's IT server. The attack knocked Expresso and SIC websites offline, in addition to SIC’s internet streaming service.. Following takeover of the Expresso and SIC websites, the Lapsus$ group posted a ransom note in Portuguese which translates to: The data will be leaked if the required amount is not paid. We have access to their cloud dashboards (AWS), among other types of devices. This was followed by the Lapsus$ group' Telegram ID and email address.. Soon after, the Lapsus$ group posted from Expresso's official Twitter account saying Lapsus$ is officially the new president of Portugal.. A report by news agency Reuters also says that the Lapsus$ group sent a phishing e-mail to Expresso subscribers.. The Impresa group has not responded to Information Security Media Group's request for information on the nature of intrusion or demands made by the ransomware group.. The Lapsus$ Ransomware Group. Avkash Kathiriya, vice president of research and innovation at cybersecurity firm Cyware tells ISMG that the Lapsus$ group hit the limelight in December 2021 following a ransomware attack on websites owned by Brazil's Ministry of Health. The group claimed to have stolen and subsequently deleted around 50TB of data from the ministry’s systems.. Following the cyberattack on Brazil’s health ministry, Lapsus$ also claimed to have breached Brazilian telecom provider Claro and allegedly gained access to a gargantuan data trove of 10,000TB, according to Kathiriya.. Kathiriya says that based on the messaging on its website and Telegram channel, the group is financially motivated and does not seem to be focused on any particular industry. The group initiated its Telegram channel on Dec. 10, 2021, as a medium to expose its victims and provide evidence of breaches.. Targeting Portuguese-speaking countries and usage of the Brazilian Portuguese dialect in its messages hints at the fact that the group may be based in Brazil, says Kathiriya.. He points out that in most of its attacks, the Lapsus$ group claimed to have gained access to cloud-based servers and applications of the targeted organizations, such as AWS instances and VMware vCenter servers, but so far it is unclear which malware is being used by the group.. News Outlets Under Attack - 3 Ransomware Hits in 3 Weeks. The cyberattack on Impresa is the third security incident in the news publication space in just three weeks - all three incidents were the result of ransomware attacks and all of the affected news websites were knocked offline for an extended period.. An incident very similar to Lapsus$ group's ransomware attacks on Expresso and SIC websites occurred on December 28, when a ransomware attack on Norway-based media company Amedia brought its presses to a halt.. According to a report on Digi.no, Amedia's executive vice president of technology, Pål Nedregotten, said in a press conference that a known security hole in Windows was exploited and that impacted Amedia's Windows servers.. Preceding Amedia's ransomware incident, the Philippines' biggest and oldest television broadcaster, ABS-CBN, fell prey to a cyberattack on December 11. According to local media organization Rappler, ABS-CBN's News website was targeted by a distributed denial of service or DDoS attack.. As with Portugal's Impresa group, ABS-CBN was also forced to push its news updates through its social media channels.. A report by cybersecurity company Fortinet says that media companies using outdated software and ineffective authentication and verification procedures coupled with an ever-increasing attack surface gives hackers a range of options to attack their digital infrastructure.. Fortinet advises media firms to apply least privilege access, deploy multi-factor authentication and run backups frequently along with regular pen-testing and patching exercises.. In a 2015 cyberattack which resulted in a dozen TV5 Monde channels blacking out simultaneously, IT company Atos found that TV5 Monde multimedia servers had their remote desktop protocol ports exposed to the internet and the staff was using default usernames and passwords.. Using social engineering, hackers targeted TV5 Monde's journalists and were eventually successful in penetrating the network through a Trojan and deploying malware in TV5 Monde's IT infrastructure, following which they were able to create accounts with administrator privileges.</td>\n",
